        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>They're portable, sort of like a mini pizza, except shaped like a cupcake. They're a great savory snack and a great addition to a game day buffet. Feel free to customize to your family's tastes with additions like ham, sausage, bell peppers, salami, mushrooms, olives, jalapenos, etc. I recommend not omitting the tomato, that really adds something special.</p>
        <p>15 minutes prep and 20 minutes cooking. Serves 8 people.</p>
